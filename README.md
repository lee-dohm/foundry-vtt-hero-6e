## How to Contribute

Right now, this effort is in the _**very**_ early stages. It has not yet reached the testing phase, I'm still figuring out how the Foundry API works and slowly adding things in.

However, I have begun documenting the local development process in the [CONTRIBUTING guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), so if you're interested in trying things out and seeing where things are at, please feel free.

# HERO System 6E Game System for Foundry VTT

This was intended to be a [HERO System 6<sup>th</sup> Edition][hero] game system package for the [Foundry VTT][foundry] virtual table top role playing game system. Since I started the project, [an official Foundry system for Hero][official] has been started. Because of this, I'm archiving this project and recommending everyone check out the official system instead:

[foundry]: https://foundryvtt.com
[official]: https://www.uberwald.me/gitea/public/fvtt-hero-system-6

## How to Contribute

Right now, this effort is in the _**very**_ early stages. It has not yet reached the testing phase, I'm still figuring out how the Foundry API works and slowly adding things in.

However, I have begun documenting the local development process in the [CONTRIBUTING guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), so if you're interested in trying things out and seeing where things are at, please feel free.
